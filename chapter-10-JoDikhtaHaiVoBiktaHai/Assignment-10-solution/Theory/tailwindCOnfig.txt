In tailwind.config.js, what does all the keys mean (content, theme, extend, plugins)?

Here's a breakdown of the key sections in the tailwind.config.js file:

1. content: This key defines the files Tailwind should scan for class names.
            Tailwind CSS will analyze these files and generate only the CSS needed for the classes you use.
            Typically, you'll specify paths to your HTML, JavaScript, React components, or 
            any other files where you use Tailwind CSS classes.
            Example: content: ['./src/**/*.{html,js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],

2. theme: This key allows you to customize the default design system in Tailwind CSS.
          Inside theme, you can override or add your own colors, spacing, typography, and other design tokens.
          It's the main section to adjust Tailwind's base styles to fit your design requirements.
          Example: theme: {
                        colors: {
                        blue: '#1DA1F2',
                        red: '#E0245E',
                        },
                    }

3. extend: The extend key is a sub-object inside theme that 
           allows you to add new values or extend existing ones without completely overriding them.
           It's the preferred way to add custom styles while still keeping the default Tailwind styles available.
           Example : extend: {
                        spacing: {
                            '72': '18rem',
                            '84': '21rem',
                        },
                        colors: {
                            teal: {
                            100: '#E6FFFA',
                            900: '#1D4044',
                            },
                        },
                     }

4. plugins: This key allows you to include additional functionality or 
            custom utilities by adding third-party plugins or writing your own custom plugins.
            Plugins can help add features like forms, typography, aspect-ratio, and more 
            that are not included by default in Tailwind CSS.
            Example : plugins: [
                        require('@tailwindcss/forms'),
                        require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
                      ],
