Virtual DOM -> In React, the virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept.
               That keeps a virtual representation of a user interface (UI) in memory and syncs it with the real DOM.
               This process is called reconciliation.
               The VDOM helps React improve performance by:
               1. Updating only necessary parts
               2. Preventing wasteful DOM manipulation : The VDOM prevents unnecessary DOM manipulation.
