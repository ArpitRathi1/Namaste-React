Reconciliation -> Reconciliation is a process in React that 
                  updates the user interface (UI) by comparing the virtual DOM to the actual DOM and making the necessary changes.
                  Reconciliation is React's way of diffing the virtual DOM tree with the updated virtual DOM 
                  to determine the most efficient way to update the real DOM.
                  To compare virtual DOM with actual DOM React uses diff algorithm.
