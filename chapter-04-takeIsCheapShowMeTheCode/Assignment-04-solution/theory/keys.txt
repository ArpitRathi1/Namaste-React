keys -> Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. 
        Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity.
        Most often you would use IDs from your data as keys:
        
        const todoItems = todos.map((todo) =>
            <li key={todo.id}>
                {todo.text}
            </li>
        );

        When you don’t have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last resort:

        const todoItems = todos.map((todo, index) =>
            // Only do this if items have no stable IDs
            <li key={index}>
                {todo.text}
            </li>
        );

        We don’t recommend using indexes for keys if the order of items may change. 
        This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state. 
        Keys Must Only Be Unique Among Siblings.

        no key <<<<<<<<<< index key (use only when you dont have anything) <<< unique key (best practice)
