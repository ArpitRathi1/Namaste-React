configuration-driven UI (CDUI) -> A configuration-driven UI (CDUI) is a user interface 
                                  that is created using a configuration file, such as JSON to define the UI's layout and content.


Here are some benefits of CDUI:
1. Flexibility : The configuration data can be easily modified or replaced without affecting the underlying application logic.
2. Adaptability : The UI can be tailored to different use cases or user groups without the need for extensive coding.
3. Customization : The UI can be customized without the need for code alterations or real-time server control.

CDUI is particularly useful in situations where flexibility and adaptability are key.
Config-driven UI is a technique that allows you to create dynamic and customizable UIs without hard coding them.
