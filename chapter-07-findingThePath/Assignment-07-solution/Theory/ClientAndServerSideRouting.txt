The main difference between client-side routing and server-side routing is how a user navigates to a new page on a website: 

Client-side routing : The app updates the URL and renders new UI without making a request to the server.
                      This results in a faster user experience, especially for single-page applications (SPAs).

Server-side routing : The server sends the HTML of the new page to the browser, which reloads the entire page.
                      This is the traditional approach to routing, and it's usually faster to load the initial page.
                      However, each request results in a full page refresh, which can be inefficient.
