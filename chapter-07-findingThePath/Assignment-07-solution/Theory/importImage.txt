Ways to Display Images in React JS
1. Using import keyword.
2. Using URLs 

1. Using import keyword -> You can import images directly into your component when they are stored in the project directory.
                           This method is useful when dealing with small images or when using static assets.

import React from 'react';
import logo from './logo.png';  // Importing image from the src folder

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to My App</h1>
      <img src={logo} alt="App Logo" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

2. Using URLs -> You can also use external image URLs in your components. 
                 This is common for dynamically loading images or when using a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
import React from 'react';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to My App</h1>
      <img src="https://example.com/logo.png" alt="App Logo" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
