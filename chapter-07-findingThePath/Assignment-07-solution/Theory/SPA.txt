SPA -> Previously when we want to move to one page to another, we have to make network call every time.
       But in react we build single page applications, which means we don't have to make network call every to load a component.
       A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application that 
       loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the content as the user interacts with the application.
       In React we use React router to build a SPA.
