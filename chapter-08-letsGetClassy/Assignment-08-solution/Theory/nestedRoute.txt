Nested Route -> Route within route is known as Nested route.
                Suppose if we want to create a profile route inside about route.
                We can do this by children of children.
                which means we can pass a children property in our about.
                we can to give relative path in profile. 
                which means give only profile, not /about/profile.
                also don't give / before profile. otherwise react will consider it as localhost:1234/profile.
                Now for this profile children we have to create an Outlet,
                and Outlet must be created in parent component.

const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path : "/",
    element : <AppLayout />,
    errorElement : <Error />,
    children : [
      {
        path : "/",
        element : <Body />
      },
      {
        path : "/about",
        element : <About />,
        children : [
          {
            path : "profile",      // localhost:1234/about/profile
            element : <ProfileClass name="ArpitClass" age={10}/>
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        path : "/contact",
        element : <Contact />
      },
      {
        path : "/meal/:id",                // This id is dynamic
        element : <MealDetails></MealDetails>
      }
    ]
  },

])
