Monolith -> monolithic is a traditional application architectures, 
            where all the application's features are coded into a single executable application. 
            Advantages : 
            1. Easy development : When an application is built with one code base, it is easier to develop.
            2. East deployment : One executable file or directory makes deployment easier.
            3. Simplified testing : end-to-end testing can be performed faster than with a distributed application. 
            4. Easy debugging : With all code located in one place, it’s easier to follow a request and find an issue.
            Dis-Advantages : 
            1. Slower development speed : A large, monolithic application makes development more complex and slower.
            2. Scalability : You can’t scale individual components.
            3. Lack of flexibility : A monolith is constrained by the technologies already used in the monolith.
            4. Deployment : A small change to a monolithic application requires the redeployment of the entire monolith.

Microservices -> Microservices is a software development architecture that breaks large applications into smaller,independent services.
                 Each service has its own responsibility and communicates with other services through APIs.
                 Benefits : Separation of responsibilities, Faster development, easier scaling and more.
                 Advantages :
                 1. Flexible scaling
                 2. Continuous deployment
                 3. Highly maintainable and testable 
                 4. Technology flexibility
                 Dis-Advantages :
                 1. Exponential infrastructure costs 
                 2. More complex
                 3. Teams need to add another level of communication and collabration
