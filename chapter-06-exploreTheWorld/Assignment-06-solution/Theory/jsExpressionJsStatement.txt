JS Expression -> JavaScript code that produces a value is JS Expression.
                 For example, these are all expressions:
                 1 → produces 1
                 "hello" → produces "hello"
                 5 * 10 → produces 50
                 num > 100 → produces either true or false
                 isHappy ? "🙂" : "🙁" → produces an emoji
                 [1, 2, 3].pop() → produces the number 3

JS Statement -> A JavaScript program is a sequence of statements. 
                Each statement is an instruction for the computer to do something.
                Here are some examples of statements in JavaScript:
                let hi = 5;
