Conditional Rendering -> In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. 
                         Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application.
                         we use JavaScript operators like if or the conditional operator (ternary op) to create elements representing the current state, 
                         and let React update the UI to match them.

Example : 
function MissedGoal() {
  return <h1>MISSED!</h1>;
}

function MadeGoal() {
  return <h1>Goal!</h1>;
}

function Goal(props) {
  const isGoal = props.isGoal;
  if (isGoal) {
    return <MadeGoal/>;
  }
  return <MissedGoal/>;
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Goal isGoal={false} />);
