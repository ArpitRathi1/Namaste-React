There are Two ways to load a page.
1. Firstly load the page call API and then render the page.
2. Load the page render somthing then call API and then re-render the page again.
Second way to load the page is better because of user experiance.

useEffect -> In React it is not a good idea to call in API directing in your component, because
             If you do so your API is called every time your component renders.
             In React there is a better way to call API by useEffect hook. 

             useEffect hook lets you perform side effects in functional component.
             Data fetching, manually changing DOM are some example of side effects.
             If you want to do somthing on render or re-render of component, you can use useEffect.

             syntax : useEffect(setUp, dependencies)

             useEffect takes two argu:
             1. setUp : a callback function.
             2. dependencies : a dependency array.

             Whenever our component render or re-render,firstly our component renders then callback function of useEffect is called.

             case 1 : If you don't pass dependency array in useEffect,
                      Then setUp function will be called for every state varible update.
                      syntax : useEffect(() => {
                                console.log("render")
                               })
             case 2 : If you pass an empty dependency array in useEffect,
                      Then setUp function will be called only on first rendering.
                      syntax : useEffect(() => {
                                console.log("render")
                               }, [])
             case 3 : If you want to call setUp function on a specific state update,
                      Then you can pass that state in dependencies.
                      syntax : useEffect(() => {
                                console.log("render")
                               }, [stateVaribleName1, stateVaribleName2])       

Conditional rendering -> In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. 
                         Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application.
                         (Adding element on the basic of some Condition)
