State -> Every component in react maintains a state, and we can put all the varibles in this state.
         State is a built-in react object that is used to contain data or info about the component.
         A component state can be change over-time.
         whenever it changes, the component re-renders.

State varible -> Varible which are maintained by react's state is known as state varible.
                 State varibles are very important in react because if you create varible same like js varible(using let or const).
                 react will not keep track  of that varible.
                 and if you update those varible your UI will not be updated accordingly.
                 If you want you UI to be in sync with your varibles than you should always create state varible.
                 All keeps a track of all state varibles.

useState -> useState() is a react hook which is used to create state varibles.
            useState() returns an array which has to items.
            first is name of state varible.
            second is function to update this state varible.
            syntax : const [varibleName, functionToUpdateVariable] = useState()
