Import-export -> The magic of components lies in their reusability: 
                 you can create components that are composed of other components. 
                 But as you nest more and more components, it often makes sense to start splitting them into different files. 
                 This lets you keep your files easy to scan and reuse components in more places.

You can move a component in three steps:
1. Make a new JS file to put the components in.
2. Export your function component from that file (using either default or named exports).
3. Import it in the file where youâ€™ll use the component (using the corresponding technique for importing default or named exports).

Exporting -> There are two ways of exporting a file.

1. Default export -> Default export are handy for exporting single value and giving it a custom name when importing.
                     We can change the name in default export while importing,
                     But always give it the same name (Best practice)
                     We can only export onething using default export.
                     syntax for exporting : export default FileName
                     syntax for importing : import FileName from "path"

2. Named export -> Named export are useful when you want to export multiple values and import them with their specific name,
                   We can't change the name in named export while importing.
                   syntax for exporting : export { FileName1, FileName2 }
                   syntax for importing : import { FileName1, FileName2 } from "path"
                   In named import (import { FileName1, FileName2 } from "path") this looks object destructuring,
                   but this is not object destructuring, this is only the syntax of react.
