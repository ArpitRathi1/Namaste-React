React ->
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
It provides a declarative and component-based approach to building UI components. 
With React, you can create reusable and modular UI components that encapsulate their own logic and rendering behavior. 
React introduces the concept of a "virtual DOM," which is an abstraction of the actual DOM.

Virtual DOM -> 
In React, the virtual DOM is a programming concept that stores a copy of a browser's DOM in JavaScript memory.
This copy is then updated and compared to the actual DOM to determine what to render. 

The virtual DOM helps React by:
1. Updating only necessary parts
2. Improving performance

React-DOM -> 
A package that connects React's Virtual DOM to the browser's DOM. 
React DOM's primary function is to render React components into the DOM. 
React DOM is used exclusively in web apps.

React and React DOM were split into two libraries to support React Native, a React platform for mobile development.
