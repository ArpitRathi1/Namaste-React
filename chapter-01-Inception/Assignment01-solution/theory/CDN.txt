CDN -> 
A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of interconnected servers that speeds up webpage loading for data-heavy applications. 
When a user visits a website, data from that website's server has to travel across the internet to reach the user's computer.
If the user is located far from that server, it will take a long time to load a large file, such as a video or website image.
Instead, the website content is stored on CDN servers geographically closer to the users and reaches their computers much faster.

Benefits of CDNs -> 
1. Reduce page load time
2. Improve website security
