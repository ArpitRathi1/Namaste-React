node_modules -> The node_modules folder is a directory in NodeJS projects that stores third-party libraries and dependencies. 
                Itâ€™s essential for managing dependencies, which are packages or modules that a NodeJS project relies on.
                We should put our node_modules in gitignore because out package.json has enough info to recreate it again.
