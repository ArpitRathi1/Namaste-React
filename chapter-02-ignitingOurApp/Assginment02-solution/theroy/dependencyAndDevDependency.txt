Dependencies -> These are libraries and frameworks that are required by an application's code to function. 
                They are essential for a production build.

devDependencies -> These are tools and libraries that help with the development process, but are not required for the app to run. 
                   They are only needed for local development and testing. 
                   DevDependencies are not installed in a production environment or in a host project.

The main difference between dependencies and devDependencies is that dependencies are required for an application to run in production, 
while devDependencies are only needed for development and testing.
