Tree Shaking -> Tree shaking is a technique used in JavaScript to remove unused code from a bundle, 
                which can help improve performance and reduce file size. 
                It's a popular concept in modern web development because of the rise of ES6 import and export statements.
                Tree shaking is important for preparing code for production by reducing file size and creating clean structures.
